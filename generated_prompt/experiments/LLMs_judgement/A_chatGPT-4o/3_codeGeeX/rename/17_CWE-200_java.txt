Input_Code: 
@Override
public String toString() {
    StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
    if (source != null) {
        s.append("remoteAddress=").append(source);
    }
    if (customerIdentification != null) {
        if (s.length() > 0) {
            s.append(", ");
        }
        s.append("clientId=").append(customerIdentification);
    }
    #ToGenerate
}

Reference_Code: return s.toString(); 

Generated_Code: return s.toString();


Task Description:  
You are an annotator. Your task is to assess the functional and semantic similarity between the Generated_Code and the Reference_Code, considering the context provided by the Input_Code.  

Please assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how well the Generated_Code aligns with the Reference_Code in terms of correctness, relevance, and completeness:  
1 — completely irrelevant or incorrect  
2 — mostly incorrect, with some minor overlap  
3 — partially correct or relevant, but incomplete  
4 — mostly correct, with minor differences  
5 — fully correct and functionally equivalent  

Only use the Reference_Code as the gold-standard answer. Do not consider stylistic preferences or surface-level formatting unless it affects correctness.
