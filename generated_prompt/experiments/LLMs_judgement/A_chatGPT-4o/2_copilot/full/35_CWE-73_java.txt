Task Description:  
You are an annotator. Your task is to assess the functional and semantic similarity between the Generated_Code and the Reference_Code, considering the context provided by the Input_Code.  

Please assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how well the Generated_Code aligns with the Reference_Code in terms of correctness, relevance, and completeness:  
1 — completely irrelevant or incorrect  
2 — mostly incorrect, with some minor overlap  
3 — partially correct or relevant, but incomplete  
4 — mostly correct, with minor differences  
5 — fully correct and functionally equivalent  

Only use the Reference_Code as the gold-standard answer. Do not consider stylistic preferences or surface-level formatting unless it affects correctness.
