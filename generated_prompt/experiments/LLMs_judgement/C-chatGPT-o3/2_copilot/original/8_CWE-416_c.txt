Input_Code: 
#include <string>
void work(const char*);
void work_with_combined_string(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
#ToGenerate
}
 
Reference_Code: 
	auto combined_string = s1 + s2;
 	work(combined_string.c_str());  

Generated_Code: 
// This function is intended to combine two strings and pass them to work.
    // However, it does not handle the case where the combined string exceeds
    // the maximum length allowed by work.
    
    // Combine the two strings
    std::string combined = s1 + s2;
    
    // Call work with the combined string
    work(combined.c_str());

Task Description:  
You are an annotator. Your task is to assess the functional and semantic similarity between the Generated_Code and the Reference_Code, considering the context provided by the Input_Code.  

Please assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how well the Generated_Code aligns with the Reference_Code in terms of correctness, relevance, and completeness:  
1 — completely irrelevant or incorrect  
2 — mostly incorrect, with some minor overlap  
3 — partially correct or relevant, but incomplete  
4 — mostly correct, with minor differences  
5 — fully correct and functionally equivalent  

Only use the Reference_Code as the gold-standard answer. Do not consider stylistic preferences or surface-level formatting unless it affects correctness.
