Input_Code:
void good(const char *secretKey) {
  const char *password = "cleartext password";
  sqlite3_stmt *stmt;
  sqlite3 *credentialsDB;
  if (sqlite3_open("credentials.db", &credentialsDB) == SQLITE_OK) {
    #ToGenerate
    if (sqlite3_prepare_v2(credentialsDB, "INSERT INTO creds(password) VALUES(?)", -1, &stmt, NULL) == SQLITE_OK) {
      sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, password, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
      sqlite3_step(stmt);
      sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
      sqlite3_close(credentialsDB);
    }
  }
}  
Reference_Code: 
    std::string setKeyString = std::string("PRAGMA key = '") + secretKey + "'";
    sqlite3_exec(credentialsDB, setKeyString.c_str(), NULL, NULL, NULL);
    sqlite3_exec(credentialsDB, "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS creds (password TEXT);", NULL, NULL, NULL);

Generated_Code: 
if (sqlite3_exec(credentialsDB, ""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS creds(password TEXT)"", NULL, NULL, NULL) != SQLITE_OK) {
      sqlite3_close(credentialsDB);
      return;
    }


Task Description:  
You are an annotator. Your task is to assess the functional and semantic similarity between the Generated_Code and the Reference_Code, considering the context provided by the Input_Code.  

Please assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how well the Generated_Code aligns with the Reference_Code in terms of correctness, relevance, and completeness:  
1 — completely irrelevant or incorrect  
2 — mostly incorrect, with some minor overlap  
3 — partially correct or relevant, but incomplete  
4 — mostly correct, with minor differences  
5 — fully correct and functionally equivalent  

Only use the Reference_Code as the gold-standard answer. Do not consider stylistic preferences or surface-level formatting unless it affects correctness.
