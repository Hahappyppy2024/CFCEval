def create_prompt():
    Code_input:
    Generated_code:
    The prompt is designed in two parts: the first part presents the original input code
    and the second part provides a set of candidate outputs generated by different Code LLMs based on the input
    Annotators are instructed to assess each generated code snippet with reference to the input code and
    assign a quality score on a 1â€“5 scale, where 1 indicates poor relevance or correctness
    and 5 indicates excellent alignment.
