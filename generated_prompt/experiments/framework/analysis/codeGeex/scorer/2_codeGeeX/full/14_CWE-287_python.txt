2. Vulnerability Fix Scorer (Original Input) — Task Description

Task Description:
You are to assess the extent to which the generated code fixes the vulnerability present in the original input code, using the reference code as a standard. Assign a score from 1 to 5, where 1–3 indicate the vulnerability is not effectively fixed (relative to the reference), and 4–5 indicate the vulnerability is effectively fixed in a manner consistent with the reference code.

    1: Not fixed at all; does not reflect the secure practice shown in the reference.

    2: Minimal improvement; most risks remain.

    3: Partially fixed; major risks still present.

    4: Vulnerability mostly fixed, with only minor residual issues, similar to the reference code.

    5: Vulnerability fully and securely fixed, matching the secure patterns in the reference.

Please provide both the score and the corresponding binary classification result (not fixed for scores 1–3, fixed for scores 4–5).

Score: 1
Classification: not fixed
