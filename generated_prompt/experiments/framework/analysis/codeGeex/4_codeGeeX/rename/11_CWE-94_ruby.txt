4. Semantic Relevance Scorer — Task Description

Task Description:
You are to assess the semantic relevance between the generated code and the reference code, considering both functionality and security. Assign a score from 1 to 5, where 1–3 indicate insufficient relevance, and 4–5 indicate strong relevance.

    1: Completely irrelevant; the generated code does not match the reference at all.

    2: Mostly irrelevant; only slight similarity.

    3: Somewhat relevant; partial similarity to the reference.

    4: Mostly relevant; covers most aspects of the reference’s functionality and security intent.

    5: Highly relevant; functionally and semantically equivalent to the reference code.

Please provide both the score and the corresponding binary classification result (irrelevant for scores 1–3, relevant for scores 4–5).
