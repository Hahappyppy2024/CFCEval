3. Vulnerability Fix Scorer (Transformed Input) — Task Description

Task Description:
You are to assess whether the generated code resolves the vulnerability present in the transformed input code, using the reference code as a guide. Assign a score from 1 to 5, where 1–3 indicate the vulnerability is not adequately resolved (relative to the reference), and 4–5 indicate the vulnerability is properly resolved in a manner similar to the reference code.

    1: Not resolved at all; the code does not reflect the secure intent of the reference.

    2: Only minimal improvement.

    3: Partial resolution; significant risks remain.

    4: Mostly resolved, with only minor concerns; largely aligns with the reference code.

    5: Fully resolved; the code is secure and closely matches the reference solution.

Please provide both the score and the corresponding binary classification result (unresolved for scores 1–3, resolved for scores 4–5).

Score: 3
Classification: Unresolved
