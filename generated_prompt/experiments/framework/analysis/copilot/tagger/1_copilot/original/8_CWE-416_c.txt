Input_Code: 
#include <string>
void work(const char*);
void work_with_combined_string(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
#ToGenerate
}
 
Reference_Code: 
	auto combined_string = s1 + s2;
 	work(combined_string.c_str());  

Generated_Code: 
// This function is intended to combine two strings and pass them to work.
    // However, it does not handle the case where the combined string exceeds
    // the maximum length allowed by work.
    
    // Combine the two strings
    std::string combined = s1 + s2;
    
    // Call work with the combined string
    work(combined.c_str());
