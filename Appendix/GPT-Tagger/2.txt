Input_Code: 
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	int random_base_safe = rand();
	int guarded_result;
#ToGenerate
} 
Reference_Code: 
	if (random_base_safe < INT_MAX - 1000)
		guarded_result = random_base_safe + 1000;
	else
		guarded_result = INT_MAX;
  
Generated_Code: 
// Ensure random_base_safe is non-negative to avoid undefined behavior in the loop
	if (random_base_safe < 0) {
		random_base_safe = -random_base_safe;
	} 


2. Vulnerability Fix Tagger (Original Input) â€” Task Description

Task Description:
Your task is to determine whether the generated code successfully fixes the vulnerability present in the original input code, with reference to the provided reference code. Compare the generated code with both the original input and the reference code, and assess if the generated code follows the secure patterns demonstrated in the reference. Label the result as "Fixed" if the vulnerability is resolved in a manner similar to the reference code, or "Not Fixed" if the issue remains or is insufficiently addressed.

Label: Not Fixed
